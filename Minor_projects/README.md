# 🤖 AI-PM Micro-Projects: Logic & Automation Lab

**Author:** Abhinav Shrivastav  
**Focus:** AI Product Management | Technical Logic | Product Lifecycle Automation

## 🎯 Project Vision

As an AI Product Manager, bridging the gap between high-level product strategy and low-level technical execution is critical. This repository serves as a "Logic Lab" where I translate product requirements into Python-based solutions.

Each project here is a micro-simulation of real-world AI PM challenges:

- **Resource Scaling:** Managing GPU/Hardware inventory.
- **Decision Logic:** Automating feature prioritization.
- **System Health:** Monitoring vitals for AI-driven robotics.

## 🏗️ Core Micro-Projects

### 🏥 Robot Health Monitor (`robot_health.py`)

- **Problem:** Proactive maintenance is required to prevent downtime in AI-integrated hardware.
- **Solution:** Threshold-based logic to monitor system vitals and trigger status alerts (CPU/RAM).
- **Documentation:** [View Robot Health Logic](robot_health.txt)

### 📦 Inventory Lifecycle Manager (`inventory_manager.py`)

- **Problem:** Manual tracking of high-demand AI hardware leads to stock inaccuracies.
- **Solution:** A dynamic inventory system managing chip lifecycles (A100, H100, B100) using list manipulation.
- **Documentation:** [View Inventory Logic](inventory_manager.txt)

### 📊 Feature Ranking Engine (`ranking_number.py`)

- **Problem:** Product backlogs often lack objective numerical prioritization.
- **Solution:** A script that processes and ranks datasets to identify high-priority features.
- **Documentation:** [View Ranking Logic](ranking_number.txt)

### 🔢 Metric Extractor (`largest_number.py`)

- **Problem:** Need quick identification of peak performance values from raw data.
- **Solution:** Comparison logic to instantly isolate the highest value in a dataset for A/B testing metrics.
- **Documentation:** [View Metric Logic](largest_number.txt)
