PROJECT: AI Hardware Inventory Lifecycle Manager
AUTHOR: Abhinav Shrivastav
=====================================================

--- OVERVIEW ---
This tool simulates the management of high-performance GPU inventory 
essential for AI infrastructure. It demonstrates the ability to 
handle dynamic data collections (Product SKUs) through their 
lifecycle—from launch to discontinuation.

--- TECHNICAL LOGIC ---
1. DATA STRUCTURE: Utilizes Python Lists [] for ordered storage.
2. EXPANSION: Uses .append() to simulate new product launches 
   (e.g., adding RTX 4090).
3. ANALYTICS: Employs len() to provide real-time reporting on 
   the total number of active product lines.
4. LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT: Implements conditional logic (if-in) 
   and .remove() to safely decommission legacy hardware (e.g., A100).

--- INITIAL STOCK ---
- A100 (Legacy)
- H100 (Enterprise Standard)
- B100 (Next-Gen)

--- TARGET OUTCOME ---
Ensures that product portfolios remain updated and that the 
logic prevents errors when attempting to remove non-existent SKUs.
