PROJECT: RANDOM GRADING LOGIC ENGINE
AUTHOR: Abhinav Shrivastav
SECTION: 06 - If-Else Conditionals
LEVEL: Intermediate
==========================================================

[1. CONCEPT DESCRIPTION]
This script demonstrates the use of conditional "Logic Gates" 
to automate decision-making. By generating a random integer 
between 1 and 100, the program evaluates the input against 
pre-defined business thresholds (90 for A, 70 for B).

[2. TECHNICAL LOGIC]
- Library: random (used for data simulation)
- Structure: Function-based logic with a 'for' loop execution
- Logic: 
    * IF score >= 90  -> Result: Grade A
    * ELIF score >= 70 -> Result: Grade B
    * ELSE             -> Result: Need Improvement

[3. PYTHON CODE]
----------------------------------------------------------
import random

def grade_random_func(score):
    if score >= 90:
        print(f'you scored: {score}, and you got Grade A')
    elif score >= 70:
        print(f'you scored: {score}, and you got Grade B')
    else:
        print(f'Need Improvement, You scored {score}')

# Execution loop for 5 simulated students
for i in range(5):
    score = random.randint(1, 100)
    grade_random_func(score)
----------------------------------------------------------

[4. AI-PM INSIGHTS]
As an AI Product Manager, this logic represents a "Classification 
Threshold." In real-world AI:
- Thresholds define how a model categorizes data.
- 'Random' simulation is used for stress-testing edge cases.
- Logic like this is the foundation for 'Action-Trigger' 
  systems in robotics and automated customer support.

[5. LAB NOTES]
- Ensure the 'random' module is imported at the top.
- The 'elif' condition is optimized to check only the lower 
  boundary since the upper boundary is handled by the first 'if'.
